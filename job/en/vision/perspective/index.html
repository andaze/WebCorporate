However, various conditions are involved in delivery operations, such as the progress of work, ever-changing road conditions, and the condition of workers and drivers. This is why we are using high-performance AI to solve problems that are beyond human capabilities, such as managing optimal delivery routes and driving details, and sorting packages, to create innovations that will dominate B2B logistics.

The Indians working there were all demonstrating a high level of technical skills on a global level. However, the environment at that time was such that following plans and budgets were considered to be of utmost importance, and results were put on the back burner. The representative questioned such methods and returned to Japan in 2016. He founded Andaze, a company that can commit to &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; and &ldquo;goals&rdquo; using the latest technology. In order to achieve Andaze&rsquo;s mission, the power of talented Indian engineers is indispensable. To this end, we will hire a series of talented engineers from India&rsquo;s highest academic institutions to form a development team specializing in Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud technology.<br>Currently, there are about 20 employees in India and 12 Japanese and non-Japanese employees in Japan.
