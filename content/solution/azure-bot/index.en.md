Why are “chatbots” getting so much attention? A chatbot is a combination of chat and bot, which means "a robot that talks." It is not a physical robot but a communication tool for companies.

Even in work style reforms aimed at improving labor productivity, there is an urgent need to improve work efficiency, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Chatbots are IT tools that help improve operations together with RPA.

### Case

**Industry**: Securities

**Request**: Reduced frequent internal inquiries to the IT department

**Solution**: Since Office 365 E3 was already used by users, we set up an inquiry bot by Bot-Framework and Q&A Maker so that it could be used by company operators. For atypical questions, the Handoff feature transferred conversations from bots to humans. After applying the solution, we were able to reduce most of the telephone inquiries.
