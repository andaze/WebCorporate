### Overview

AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages, commonly known as amp) is a standard jointly launched by Google and Twitter to enable mobile users to comfortably view websites. The literal translation means "faster pages for mobile.

AMP enables search engines to read information on web pages ahead of time and direct links from search results to them, so that data can be displayed without having to jump to the page each time. Users will spend more time on the site because they will not have to wait as long and will get a much better impression of the site.
