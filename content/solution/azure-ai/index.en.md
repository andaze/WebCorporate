## Overview

In recent years, with the spread of smartphones and IoT, a large amount of data has been accumulated. Analyzing this data by humans takes an enormous amount of time and effort. On the other hand, AI machine learning makes it possible to discover regularities that cannot be found by human power and to finish the analysis work in an instant. At Andaze, our professionals develop AI with high prediction accuracy. Andaze professionals develop AI with high forecasting accuracy, contributing to corporate business innovation through technology.

## Case Study

### Industry:

Securities industry

### Ploblem:

To calculate an original fair value of stock price

### Solution:

Financial information of listed companies, including past data, was obtained from EDINET and used as teacher data. Then, basic statistics and clustering were applied to analyze the correlation between characteristics and stock prices at a coarse granularity, and a desk model was created. We then created a provisional model based on multiple regression and quantification, and worked to improve the primary accuracy of the model through the use of features and their transformations. After receiving a certain evaluation from the field in terms of both theory and accuracy, we selected algorithms for production modeling, and finally created models for each cluster. We succeeded in creating a fair value calculation from a unique perspective, which is now being used for investment decisions.
