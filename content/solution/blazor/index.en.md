The next content can be displayed without having to click on a link and reload the page. Andaze provides comfortable web expressions that run crisply, not to mention improved visuals and usability.

### Case Study

**Industry**: Recruitment service industry  

**Problem**: The response time of the B2B human resource information system was poor, and users were requesting improvements.  

**Solution**: When aggregating personnel data, the company required instantaneous data display and comparison while freely changing search conditions. We selected an SPA architecture and created a prototype using the Blazor-Client model in WebAssembly, but found that there was a development productivity problem during debugging. We decided to operate with the Blazor-Server model for the time being and migrate to Blazor-Client when the time was right. While we are now safely enjoying the benefits of the new technology, we expect further performance improvements at the next time.
