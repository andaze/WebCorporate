Why is “single page application (SPA)” getting so much attention? This is because, instead of reading the contents for each page from the browser, you can change the functions and contents by replacing only the necessary data. SPAs can greatly improve the user's impression of your application. It not only improves appearance and usability, but also provides a crisp movement. Slack and Google Map web pages are well known examples of using SPA.

**Pros of using SPA**

- You can realize things that you could not experience with ordinary web pages
- High speed page display and function switching
- Act as a replacement for native apps

**Cons**

- First access takes time to load
- Doesn't work on older browsers

The trend is for native applications to replace SPAs. If you develop new applications in the future, you should include SPA as a candidate.

We will build SPA quickly with **SPA framework BLAZOR**. Please contact our professionals to understand your current situation and plan a plan.

### Case

**Industry**: Employment placement service

**Issues**: The response of the personnel information system provided by B2B is poor, and users are requesting improvements.

**Solution**: Regarding the aggregation of personnel data, it was required to change the search conditions freely and instantly display the data for comparison. When SPA architecture was selected and a prototype was created using the Blazor-Client model in WebAssembly, it became clear that there was a problem in development productivity during debugging. For the time being, it was decided to use the Blazor-Server model temporarily and switch to Blazor-Client after a while. While safely benefiting from the new technology, further performance improvements are expected at the next timing.
