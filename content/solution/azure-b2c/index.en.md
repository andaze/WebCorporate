Why is "B2C development service" important? The awareness of social crisis has increased in response to the recent leak of customer information. Regarding future information leaks, it will be obligatory to report to the Personal Information Protection Committee and notify the person in question.

In B2C development, the system is constructed with emphasis on subject authentication and handling of personal information.

### Case

**Industry**: Mid-level service industry

**Number of licenses**: 700

**Request**: We are using Salesforce, but the budget ratio of license fees is high and the cost to optimize CRM is insufficient.

**Solution**: A company that was worried about license fees and governor restrictions. Since Office 365 E3 was already introduced, we have proposed Dynamics 365. For data migration, we set up a real-time data migration pipeline from Salesforce with a three month parallel uptime. In the meantime, data registration was performed from Salesforce, data reference was performed on Dynamics side, and two CRMs were operated in parallel using the same data. We asked the Dynamics side to confirm that there were no operational problems, set a switching date, and implemented the transition to Dynamics. We have achieved a smooth transition.
