## Overview

For example, real-time information, such as stock price charts and chats, is required as a product value. However, with conventional systems, information must be kept up-to-date through "periodic screen updates. This results in high communication volume, flickering screens, and other problems that can lead to a low level of user satisfaction.

Therefore, we recommend "interactive web services. An interactive web service is a system that allows users to refer to information stored in the system in real time. Through interactive communication, new information can be reflected on the user's screen in real time without the need to press an update button.
