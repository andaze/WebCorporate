Why is “Static Website Development” now attracting attention? There are three major reasons for operating a content management system (CMS) typified by Wordpress.

**Security**: Most CMSs are updated regularly. If the changes in the version upgrade are small, it will not cause a big problem, but if it is a major update, be careful. This may result in inconsistency with the installed plugins and extensions, which may lead to site malfunctions. For example, the page layout may suddenly collapse, or the contact form may behave strangely.

**Performance**: Problems such as "Slow page load speed" cannot be avoided due to the mechanism that CMS dynamically generates pages. If you have a website for now, this is not a problem. However, if you are aiming for branding and SEO through the site, you should make the site as fast as possible in order to improve the number of inflows and exits of the site as much as possible.

**Maintenance**: If CMS is installed, please expect the cost of "regular maintenance". It is necessary to check compatibility with CMS version upgrades, trouble fixes, backups, and server side updates. There is also a violent notion that "we will not upgrade", but there is a problem because the security hole is left open.

We will build a static website promptly with the **Static Site Generator HUGO**. Please contact our professionals for understanding the current situation of users and planning improvement measures.

## Case

**Site**: Our corporate website

**Problem**: It was created with Wordpress, but access is slow, maintenance cost for version upgrade is high, there is a limit to security enhancement

**Solution**: To the static code generator triggered by the release of [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/ja-jp/services/app-service/static/) Migration. Got a selection process, adopted HUGO, and managed the site on GitHub. The time and mental burden on the site manager has been reduced, and the productivity of content production has increased.

**Reference**: In [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), enter the URL of any of our corporate sites and it will be confirmed by Google that the performance is high. I can do it.
