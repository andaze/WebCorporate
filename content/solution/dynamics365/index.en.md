Why is “Customer Relationship Management” getting so much attention? It is important to continue to cultivate new customers, but it is said to be an era in which we aim to increase sales as a whole by taking more care of our current customers. We need a system that manages information about customer relationships by keeping a history of contact with customers by the system.

### Purpose of CRM

- Increase new customers
- Increase repeat rate from existing customers
- Increase service unit price
- Lower costs

The customer relationship management system can centrally manage information about prospects, sales, and after-sales service. You can flexibly customize it to suit your business.

We will promptly launch the system with the **Customer Relationship Management System Dynamics 365**. Please contact our professionals to understand your current situation and plan a plan.

### Case

**Industry**: Mid-level service industry

**Number of licenses**: 700

**Request**: We are using Salesforce, but the budget ratio of license fees is high and the cost to optimize CRM is insufficient.

**Solution**: A company that was worried about license fees and governor restrictions. Since Office 365 E3 was already introduced, we have proposed Dynamics 365. For data migration, we set up a real-time data migration pipeline from Salesforce with a three month parallel uptime. In the meantime, data registration was performed from Salesforce, data reference was performed on Dynamics side, and two CRMs were operated in parallel using the same data. We asked the Dynamics side to confirm that there were no operational problems, set a switching date, and implemented the transition to Dynamics. We have achieved a smooth transition.
