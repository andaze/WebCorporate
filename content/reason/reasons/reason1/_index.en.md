text: '"The initial plan was good, but it did not produce the desired results."<br>
"The system is complicated, difficult to use, and does not take root."<br>
"Additional costs were incurred during the project process, resulting in huge costs."<br>
These are some of the common cases we hear about when implementing a system.
<br><br>
At Andaze, our team members who have experience in new business strategy work from the top-level consulting process, so your strategy will never end up as "Pie in the sky".
<br><br>
And since Andaze is responsible for the downstream operations and maintenance, we are able to grasp changes in the business in an ongoing manner.
<br><br>
Another of our strengths is the speed of development that can only be achieved by a venture company with a mindset of change.
<br><br>
This is an environment where you can complete services that give you a competitive advantage with global standard technology at a reasonable price.
<br><br>
We will continue to accompany you with full commitment as a technology partner.
