text: '"We want to consult with you on everything from the strategy phase to the operational phase."<br> 
"It is difficult to assign different responsibilities to different systems and processes. "<br>
"We want to focus on the product rather than sticking to the original plan."<br>
These requests and concerns may arise after the request has been made.
<br><br>
Andaze provides a shared team of professionals in each field who handle everything from strategy to operation and maintenance.<br><br>
Sometimes, the team that developed the strategy is also responsible for the downstream operations and maintenance.
<br><br>
In order to provide high value-added services with a high level of consistency, we are committed to accepting prime orders and do not subcontract work to subcontractors.
<br><br>
We do not work on legacy projects, but rather on technologies that are future-proof and of global standards.
<br><br>
This is why our shared team is always highly motivated.
<br><br>
Of course, we do not stop when the product is ready; we continue to work as one team to provide the best possible environment.
<br><br>
Consistency is a prerequisite for high value-added services.
