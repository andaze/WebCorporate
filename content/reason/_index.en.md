<br><br>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-6">We take responsibility for the entire process and are fully committed to the success of your business.<h3>
The initial plan was good, but it did not produce the desired results.<br>
The system is complicated, difficult to use, and does not take root.<br>
Additional costs were incurred during the project process, resulting in huge costs.<br>
These are some of the common cases we hear about when implementing a system.<br><br>

At Andaze, our team members who have experience in new business strategy work from the top-level consulting process, so your strategy will never end up as "Pie in the sky".<br><br>

And since Andaz is responsible for the downstream operations and maintenance, we are able to grasp changes in the business in an ongoing manner.<br><br>

Another of our strengths is the speed of development that can only be achieved by a venture company with a mindset of change.<br><br>

This is an environment where you can complete services that give you a competitive advantage with global standard technology at a reasonable price.<br><br>

We will continue to accompany you with full commitment as a technology partner.<br><br>

We want to consult with you on everything from the strategy phase to the operational phase.<br>  
It is difficult to assign different responsibilities to different systems and processes. <br>
We want to focus on the product rather than sticking to the original plan.<br>
These requests and concerns may arise after the request has been made.<br><br>

Andaze provides a shared team of professionals in each field who handle everything from strategy to operation and maintenance.<br><br>

Sometimes, the team that developed the strategy is also responsible for the downstream operations and maintenance.<br><br>

In order to provide high value-added services with a high level of consistency, we are committed to accepting prime orders and do not subcontract work to subcontractors.<br><br>

We do not work on legacy projects, but rather on technologies that are future-proof and of global standards.<br><br>
