# ISEWAN TERMINAL SERVICE CO.,LTD. Devan Management

## Overview
ISEWAN TERMINAL SERVICE CO.,LTD. has been in business for more than 70 years. Starting with the Port of Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture, the company has 33 bases in major cities throughout Japan and 24 overseas bases in the U.S., Germany, China, Belgium, and Thailand. Today, ISEWAN TERMINAL SERVICE CO.,LTD. is not only a shipping company, but also a comprehensive logistics company that is active on a global scale. ISEWAN TERMINAL SERVICE CO.,LTD. has introduced "deban management. Deban management is a system that reads the case marks of cargo unloaded during "debanning," the process of removing cargo from containers arriving at ports from overseas, word for word, and compares them to the contents of customs clearance documents.

## Background of Application
In recent years, the spread of mail-order websites has made it easier for individuals to buy goods from overseas. As a result, packages have become smaller and more segmented, and sometimes arrive in "consolidation," in which container space is shared with other shippers. The case markings on cargo from overseas do not always have the same symbol number as on the customs clearance document written at the time of declaration. Sorting packages by visually checking them one by one is not only time-consuming and labor intensive, but also carries the risk of mistakes being made. Therefore, a system-based "sorting tool" was required.

## Results obtained
When a photo of the case mark is taken, the deban management system recognizes the text information on the box. The system then automatically matches the information with the customs documents and inquires detailed information about the cargo. The system can then arrange transportation to the correct destination. The system also saves any "re-marks" (scratches) found when checking the cargo as data at that stage. This system has clearly improved the efficiency and accuracy of sorting.
