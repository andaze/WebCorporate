# Nisso Industries Co.,Ltd. Power BI

## Overview
Nisso Industries Co.,Ltd. has over 50 years of experience as a specialized manufacturer of "temporary construction equipment" indispensable for building, civil engineering, and railroad construction and maintenance work. With an eye on further business expansion, the company is actively recruiting. To make hiring decisions based on data rather than human subjectivity and sensibilities, Nisso Industries Co.,Ltd. introduced POWER BI, which provides objective numerical data on the effectiveness of hiring activities, such as where the hiring process is at, which departments it has stopped at, and how long it takes from application to hiring. It enables objective numerical analysis of the effectiveness of recruiting activities.

## Background of Application
Human resource departments, which deal with multiple applicants, are working hard to make the hiring process more efficient and satisfying while facilitating each and every hiring process. However, even if only the HR department works hard, the recruiting process will not be successful. Sometimes the reason for slow hiring is that the departments or people in charge of interviewing are putting off the hiring process. However, the longer the time between application and hiring, the greater the risk that an applicant will decline the position. Therefore, a tool was needed to help each person in charge take responsibility for the hiring process.

## Results obtained
The number of applicants to job advertisements and the time from application to hiring were analyzed numerically, so that the cost effectiveness of recruiting one person could be calculated. This enables objective selection of advertising media based on numerical values.

In addition, responsibility is now "visualized," such as which departments are currently at a standstill in their recruiting activities. The staff members in charge now approach recruitment activities as "their own business," and the speed of recruitment activities has been increased. When looking back on a series of recruitment activities later, the ability to discuss them based on objective facts rather than subjectivity has also led to the discovery and resolution of essential issues.
