### "Static website development" to speed up website display and enhance security.

We often hear from corporate marketers that "even if we spend a large amount of money on advertising to drive visitors from SNS and LPs to our website, the slow website display speed results in high direct return and abandonment rates, and our conversion rate is not increasing. In fact, a global online sales company has analyzed that "a 0.1 second slower website decreases sales by 1%, while a 1 second faster website increases sales by 10%. Andaze believes that slow websites not only have a direct disadvantage in terms of product purchase and service usage, but also negatively affect company and product branding.

Andaze is developing "static websites" using "Hugo", a static website generator (website building framework) developed in the Go language, which can generate high-speed websites and reduce security risks. We recommend it to companies that want to improve the display speed of their websites, make them faster, and strengthen their security measures. ...... This technology is recommended for companies that want to improve and accelerate the display speed of their websites and enhance their security measures.

##### ●What is a static website?

Hugo, a static website generator, outputs static HTML and only publishes the HTML file when it is accessed by a user, so the same information is immediately displayed on the website no matter when or where it is viewed by anyone. The main advantages of a static website are as follows.

**(1) Faster page display speed**.

Since there is no "dynamic" page generation process to change the content of a Web page, the page does not consume server resources and loads quickly. The short display time reduces stress on the user and reduces website abandonment.

**(2) Highly secure**.

Static sites (HTML) do not use databases and consist only of static pages, so there are no plug-ins or malicious code to execute, which makes them less risky than dynamic sites (WordPress). With simple security measures in place, advanced measures are basically unnecessary.

##### More information about security

**・No management screen**

Hugo does not have an administration screen, so there is no risk of hijacking from the administration screen.

**・No plugins**

Plug-ins for dynamic websites (WordPress) are useful features that facilitate the addition of functionality, but they are often a security vulnerability. Moreover, since each plugin is created and released by a different developer, not all of them are checked by the company. Since Hugo does not have that vulnerable plugin, the security risk is low.

**・No malicious code execution**

Dynamic site generation using languages such as PHP, which is used to extend the functionality of a web server and dynamically generate web pages, carries the risk of malicious code being executed due to its mechanism, but Hugo does not use PHP, thus reducing the risk.

**(3) No server management required**

Static sites (HTML) have a simple structure that is less server-intensive and, compared to dynamic sites, is more resistant to mass access. Also, they are very easy to manage, requiring only a delivery server and no backups or maintenance if a cloud service is used.

**(4) Made in Go language**

Multi-platform Hugo is available, allowing you to run Hugo on a variety of operating systems (even iOS and Android); with Hugo you can generate sites in a variety of fast PC/mobile environments.

##### **Site: Andaze corporate site**

**Issues** We used to build our website using various systems such as FrontPage, IBM Home Page Builder and DreamWeaver. Later, when we adopted WordPress, problems occurred due to version upgrades of the mainframe and plug-ins. We were also worried about the security vulnerability, which was worrying us.

**Solutin** Deciding that a "static website" would be sufficient for a site that did not require a database, we decided to migrate to Azure Static Web Apps when it was released, and carefully searched for a tool with a "simple development environment," "quick to build," and "easy to manage. They then discovered and selected Hugo, a static site generator developed in the Google Go language. As a result, the time and mental burden on the site operations staff was reduced, and productivity in content creation increased.


**Performance** Enter the URL of any of our corporate sites in PageSpeed Insights and you will see that it is performing well by Google.

Andaze will quickly build a static website using our static site generator "Hugo". Please feel free to contact us for a consultation so that we can gain a deeper understanding of your current situation and suggest ways to improve it.
