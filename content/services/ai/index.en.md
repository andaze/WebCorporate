## Professionals with Andaze 
<!-- Why is "machine learning" attracting so much attention? With the spread of smartphones and other devices, large amounts of data have emerged. However, machine learning has made it possible to "calculate analysis results at a speed and accuracy that humans can never achieve".

**Merits of Machine Learning**.

- Predictions are calculated by learning feature quantities
- Selects models with high reproducibility by applying multiple algorithms
- Clustering classifies features and improves prediction accuracy

**Disadvantages**

- Requires a certain amount of teacher data (at least 100 cases per classification)
- Re-training is required to improve model accuracy

We quickly model machine learning in **ML.NET**, an open source AI development framework. Please contact our professionals to understand your company's current situation and to develop a plan.

### Case Study

**Industry**: Securities Industry

**Ploblem**: To calculate a unique fair value of stock price

**Solution**: We decided to obtain financial information of listed companies from EDINET, including historical data, and use it as our teacher data. Basic statistics and clustering were applied to create a desk model by analyzing the correlation between characteristics and stock prices at a coarse granularity. A provisional model was created through multiple regression and quantification, and features and their transformations were used to improve first-order accuracy. After receiving a certain level of evaluation from the field in terms of both theory and accuracy, we selected algorithms for production modeling and eventually created models for each cluster. As a result, we were able to successfully perform fair value calculations from a unique perspective, and realized their use in investment decisions.
