【Challenges companies have in recruiting】
* Not enough applications even if we put out a call for applications, we can't attract our target audience.
* Recruitment work is time consuming, making it difficult to concentrate on other tasks.
* I want to promote recruitment remotely.
* Want to control the cost of recruitment
* I want to hire people for multiple positions.
* We need experienced people who can work immediately.

### Why Choose Andaze ?
(1)	Consulting from the stage before recruitment agencies and agencies enter the market.        
We develop a recruiting plan according to your needs such as "what kind of people", "by when", "how many", and "within budget". We offer the most suitable recruitment plan from a variety of recruitment methods such as various job media, recruiting agents, SNS, and direct recruiting, etc. We flexibly handle new graduates, mid-career, temporary staffing, and part-time jobs in various industries as well as SES in the IT industry. Our services are available to clients throughout Japan.

(2)	One-stop support for companies that are not able to handle the human resource area       
For example, even in a large company that needs to hire 100 people a year, there are only two or three people in charge of the human resources department. With such a small amount of manpower, many companies may be handling a huge amount of recruiting work, such as creating job advertisements, scheduling interviews, and sending out scout e-mails. In addition, some companies may have personnel in charge of both human resources and other tasks. Andaze provides a specialized team that can outsource such time-consuming and time-consuming HR tasks.

(3)	"visualization" the results of your recruitment activities with the new "POWER BI" technology       
We provide "POWER BI", a tool to "visualize" which process is the problem, such as when HR is not getting results no matter how hard they try. From the number of days it takes from application to job offer, to the names of departments that are putting off interviews, it all becomes clear at a glance. This helps to speed up the hiring process. Also, after hiring, you can look back at the numbers to find issues and make improvements.

### Andaze Recruitment Agency Services
(1)	Job Advertisement Creation       
We create job ads to be posted on recruitment websites, and since the information is published on the web, you can reach out to potential job seekers who are still employed but considering a career change. In addition, since the advertising fee is not affected by the number of recruits, it is recommended when the number of recruits is large. Furthermore, it is also suitable for jobs that target inexperienced candidates or have a limited number of open positions.

(2)	placement      
This is a matching service that acts as an intermediary between clients who are considering employment and suitable job applicants. We carefully select and introduce suitable candidates so that we can conduct recruiting activities efficiently. In addition, since no fees are incurred until the job is filled, you can take your time until you are satisfied with the results of your recruiting activities.

(3)	direct recruiting     
This is a recruiting method that has been attracting attention in recent years. Simply put, it is a "one-stop-shop" for the talent you want. From a huge database of human resources, you can directly make an offer to a candidate who is close to your target. The cost is based on the style of paying for the use of the database. The advantage of this method is that you can know each person's work history and information, so you can hire people who are ready to work immediately and people with various types of jobs at the same time.

(4)	Recruitment outsourcing       
It can start as early as the next day and operates stably. Available on an hourly basis, we can handle a series of recruiting tasks without having to cut out tasks. Compared to hiring temporary staff in-house or temporarily hiring an agency, Andaze's professional team is safe and speedy with no training required.

### Case Studies
(1)	Case 1   

**Type of industry**：Manufacturing  

**To see**：We want to compress the cost of national and multi-professional recruitment.     

**Solutions**： In response to spot vacancies and increases in staff from various departments, advertisements and referrals were used on a case-by-case basis, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Since there are always positions available, we set up an in-house recruiting site optimized for Indeed and Google Job Search so that recruiting itself can begin immediately. By doing so, it became possible to flexibly recruit according to internal needs and reduce mismatches by consolidating the information to be conveyed. The cost of introductions and advertisements was reduced, and the site itself became an asset to the company.

(2)	Case 2

**Type of industry**：Outsourcing (Construction)   

**To see**：To solve manpower shortage in recruiting operations 

**Solutions**： Because we were recruiting nationwide for a wide range of targets from inexperienced to qualified candidates, we were constantly submitting applications to major media outlets. The company had not been able to use the scout mail and recommendation functions of each media, and had its hands full with responding to applicants and coordinating schedules. By providing proxy services for sending scout e-mails, the number of applicants was increased by approximately 18%. In addition, the company began to take on some of the tasks such as schedule adjustment and revision of drafts on a case-by-case basis.
