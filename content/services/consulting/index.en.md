# **PoC (Proof of Concept)<br>Prototyping and Prototyping Services**



## We provide "prototyping, implementation, and verification" to confirm the feasibility of system development and make investment decisions.

The first step to successful DX is PoC, which stands for "Proof of Concept", to find the feasibility of system development, to actually conduct small-scale prototyping and implementation, and to verify the results with the finished product in order to make a decision on whether or not to make an IT investment. The shortest way to achieve the project is to analyze the results verified in the PoC carefully and continue to demonstrate the effectiveness and verify defects in the production environment.

Andaz offers PoC services for companies considering the introduction of a new system or the establishment of security. when developing IoT or AI, we often invest a large amount of money utilizing unprecedented measures and technologies, and if the results are not obtained after full-scale development, the loss will be significant. Therefore, we can first create a simplified version of the system and conduct a small-scale verification to see if it is feasible at an early stage and if it can generate effects commensurate with the investment amount. We can also produce prototypes and prototypes of systems for which the idea and technical feasibility have already been determined, so please do not hesitate to contact us.

### Advantages of PoC, prototyping, and prototype production for system development

**Reduce development risk**.

PoC allows you to determine early on whether the system is feasible or not. Since verification is conducted while reproducing the actual environment, operational stability and usability can be confirmed, and development can be conducted while reducing risk.

**Reduction of wasted man-hours and costs**.

The introduction of a new service can be realized at a reduced cost, without wasting man-hours.

It also reduces wasted processes and cost increases due to failures and schedule delays.

**Internal understanding and feedback**.

By conducting a PoC and presenting evidence of feasibility and cost-effectiveness, it is easier to gain understanding from within the company. It is also possible to obtain feedback from employees on the ground and uncover problem areas.

**Smooth decision-making and investment decisions**.

If the PoC shows no technical problems and sufficient effects and results for the objectives, it can be used to promote management decision-making (investment decision) and obtain a development budget.

### ●PoC flow (Prototype/production of prototype is after 2)

**1. Goal (target value) setting**

Set the goal values for the results you want to obtain through PoC and what data you need. **2.

**2. Prototyping and implementation**

Develop a prototype of the system with the minimum necessary functionality, and then implement it in the real environment.

**3. verification**

We have the actual users use the system in a more practical manner to verify the effectiveness of the system.

**4. Evaluation**

Evaluation will be conducted based on the data obtained from the PoC. We will identify issues as well as feasibility.
