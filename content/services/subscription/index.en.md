# Support services for de-subscription, de-clouding, and de-packaging



## Support for "de-subscription, de-cloud, and de-packaging" in terms of cost, security, and system operation

Cloud services (SaaS), which have become indispensable for businesses, offer a variety of advantages, such as improved efficiency in operations and management. In addition, companies are moving away from SaaS, moving away from cloud computing, and moving away from package services. Furthermore, due to the limitations of system operations, an increasing number of companies are re-evaluating the advantages of their in-house "on-premise" systems and viewing their operations in a positive light.

Andaze will support such companies that wish to "move away from subsquare systems, cloud computing, and packages. Andaze will listen to your concerns about cost, security, performance, and other factors, as well as customization, in order to promote the optimal "de-subscription, de-cloud, and de-packaging (de-SaaS)" for your company.



### ● General de-clouding vs. Andaze de-clouding

#### General de-clouding

* Migrating a SaaS built system to on-premise

* Migrating systems from on-premise to SaaS and back to on-premise again

#### Andaze de-clouding

* Convert to a form of "hybrid cloud" by making decisions on an application-by-application basis

Andaze's de-subscription, de-cloud, and de-packaging is done by making decisions on a workload (application) by workload basis. Rather than moving everything to on-premise, we will consider cost, security, customization, system integration, and other factors, and flexibly respond by keeping necessary SaaS, and moving systems that require unique customization or high security requirements to on-premise. However, on-premise is not a conventional type of cloud, but a "private cloud (resource exclusive cloud)" in which resources in the PaaS are used exclusively by one company, and a "hybrid cloud" is built and operated by combining SaaS, a public cloud, and on-premise cloud, a private cloud. The "hybrid cloud" is a combination of a public cloud (SaaS) and a private cloud (on-premise cloud).



### ●De-subscription, de-cloud, and de-packaging using "hybrid cloud"

In the on-premise cloud within PaaS, a new system will be built with a workload design that allows movement between on-premise and SaaS, sensitive data from existing core systems will be linked, and only the necessary SaaS will continue to be used.

### ●Example of "Depackaging" needs

Company location: Tokyo / 350 employees / manufacturer  
 We used to use a major sales management system. However, because it was a packaged product, there were many specifications that did not match our business practices, making our operations inefficient. Therefore, we decided to revamp the system with full-scratch development optimized for our unique business.

Since this was a replacement of a system that was fundamental to the company, several companies with particular strengths in upstream processes such as requirements definition were considered as candidates. After consulting with several companies, we decided to request Andaze K.K. because of their shared team structure and the proposals we received.

During the development period, we received requests from our employees on site one after another that could not be realized with the previous package product. We continue to rely on Andaze for maintenance.
