## Recruitment Agency Services

Recruiting" methods and services are diversifying these days. On the other hand, many companies may find that recruiting has become a low-priority "work in progress. At Andaze, we provide one-stop support for the entire recruitment process, starting from the stage when the target "how many of these people we want to hire" is decided.

We can also outsource time-consuming tasks such as creating scout emails and scheduling. After the recruitment process, we analyze the entire process and make suggestions for improvement to enhance the quality of the recruitment process.
