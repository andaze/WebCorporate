# **Remote Time and Attendance Service**



## Monitoring attendance and productivity while protecting the privacy of remote employees

The spread of the new coronavirus outbreak has prompted an increasing number of companies to allow their employees to work remotely. Even now that the outbreak has subsided, the trend toward allowing various work styles without requiring employees to work in the office is accelerating. On the other hand, many executives and managers say, "I trust my employees and subordinates, but I don't know how they work remotely," or "I am worried about the risk of compliance violations. Against this backdrop, Andaze offers a "Remote Attendance Management Service" that manages employee attendance and monitors productivity.

### ● Not a "monitoring tool" but a "confirmation tool" based on trust

Andaze's "Remote Attendance Management Service" is a service for companies that was developed to collect PC usage data to analyze how employees are working and to get hints on how to improve more efficient work styles.

The service does not monitor employees' PCs by accessing their cameras or recording video of their screens, but only checks and manages attendance status, analyzes detailed data on labor productivity, and provides insights to help improve compliance.

### ●What the Remote Attendance Management Service will achieve

#### Data collection and aggregation

A remote time and attendance tool is installed to collect data on employee use of applications and website visits.

* The Remote Attendance Tool detects mouse and keyboard movements in the active window of the employee's PC (the screen currently selected and in operation). It does not video record the screen or access the camera on the PC to protect privacy.

* Tracks employee PC usage and automatically categorizes productive and unproductive tasks. For example, business applications widely used in the company such as "Microsoft Outlook," "Excel," and "Teams" are considered "productive," while social networking applications are considered "unproductive. However, managers may choose to change the setting to something like, "Facebook usage is also productive work for the marketing team.

#### Display of employee time usage

* The "Time Usage" feature allows you to see daily/weekly/monthly work trends, including the most used applications, total work hours, and productive work hours. It also detects "outliers" that are not related to the assigned tasks.

* The dashboard breaks down employee PC time into hourly segments: "focus time" spent on a single task, "multitasking time" spent performing multiple tasks in a short period of time, and "collaboration time" spent in meetings, chats, and emails.

#### Compliance

* Detects all employee activities (remote or on-site) that may pose a compliance risk. For example, set alerts to go off when security vulnerabilities are detected, such as using external hard drives that may compromise information, installing unauthorized software, or visiting compromised websites.

#### Productivity Report

* Visualize employee work hours and trends for both office and remote workers to help you make decisions about implementing telecommuting programs.

* Visualize total work hours and "productive work hours" for individuals, teams, and department groups.

* Identify differences between standard employee work styles and those of top performers.

* Identify overloaded employees and workload imbalances to help reallocate tasks and optimize work assignments.

* It also helps to optimize productivity by adjusting work schedules for remote workers, who tend to work long hours, to ensure a healthy work-life balance.

* Analyzes peak hours of productivity and indicates when your team is most focused and productive.

* Identify members who exhibit poor concentration and inefficiency, and suggest the need for early support to avoid the consequences of burnout and resignation.

* Set productivity, focus, and collaboration time (email, chat, meetings, etc.) goals per day to ensure that work content and workload are aligned with employee roles and responsibilities.

#### SaaS Management

* Identify the relationship between application and tool usage and productivity to ensure that SaaS is not unnecessarily growing and taking up budget. Specifically, we will identify infrequently used users, unused or unassigned licenses, and applications with duplicate functionality to avoid waste when renewing subscriptions or purchasing licenses.

The Remote Time and Attendance Service can be customized according to company policy and organization."
