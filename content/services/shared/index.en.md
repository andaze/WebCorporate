# Shared Team

{{< space height="h-10" >}}

### A diverse team of highly skilled professionals

Shared Team is a group of professionals from various fields. Each consultant, PM, and engineer takes the initiative in steering the project to achieve the goals. By not having a fixed number of team members, all Andaze staff naturally understand the client's technical information, regardless of the size of the project. We are able to provide our knowledge as needed. We do not limit the scope of work, but rather offer a flexible "quasi-contract" style that allows us to work flexibly according to your company's situation, from strategic planning to design, operation, and helpdesk services. One of our strengths is that we can utilize the know-how we have cultivated for our clients' projects because each individual has a wide range of activities. Of course, we do not divulge trade secrets.

In today's evolving technology environment, change is the norm. We spare no effort to proactively take on challenges while staying close to such a growth process. Professionals in each department exercise diverse leadership skills to drive the team. The "Shared Team", a new-age management style, brings together the high performance of each individual to support the success of projects at a reasonable price.
