# Effective use of resources

**We at Andaze believe that it is important for people living on the earth to address environmental issues such as climate change. We are working to reduce our environmental impact with the aim of achieving a sustainable society.**

### Promoting a paperless work environment

We are eliminating conventional paper-based meetings and distribution of materials to the greatest extent possible. We place emphasis on digital meetings using monitors and other devices both inside and outside the company.  
We also actively use electronic seals and contracts, and promote paperless communication with telecommuting employees and business partners as much as possible.
