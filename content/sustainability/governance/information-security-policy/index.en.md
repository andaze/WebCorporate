# Commitment to a Sustainable Society

## Top Message

Andaze was founded in 2016. The impetus for the company's founding came from my trip to India in 2011. What I experienced there, what I felt firsthand, and what I wondered about.... As a result of my search for what I could do and the pursuit of my ideals, Andaze was born. In recent years, sustainability has been positioned as an important factor in management strategy, and we have been working to provide our employees, who come from a variety of backgrounds including nationalities, with a diverse and personalized work style that allows them to work fully remotely, and to accelerate the business value generated from this work style. Our pioneering efforts are directly linked to sustainability.  
We want as many people as possible to be able to fully benefit from technology and innovation. We want to create a world where the technologies and innovations we create are taken for granted. And that this normalcy will lead to a sustainable society. In these times of new coronavirus and global change, it is difficult to predict what the future holds, but we at Andaze will continue to drive toward a sustainable society and a better way of life through the penetration of digital technology, while keeping our feet on the ground, reading ahead, and maintaining a balance.
